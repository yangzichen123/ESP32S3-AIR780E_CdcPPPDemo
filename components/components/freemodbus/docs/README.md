# ESP-Modbus Library

This folder represents the official documentation for the ESP-Modbus library (**esp-modbus component documentation**). The Modbus is a data communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The Modbus has become a de facto standard communication protocol and is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices. This library supports Modbus communication in the networks that are based on RS485 or Ethernet interfaces.
